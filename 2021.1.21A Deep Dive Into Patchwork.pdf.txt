A Deep Dive Into Patchwork
APT Group

Recently, in January 2021, the research team
at Cyble observed the Patchwork APT cyber espionage group targeting China
with a malformed document
named “Chinese_Pakistani_fighter_planes_play_war_games.docx”. We suspect
that the attack is executed in the form of spear phishing emails with
malicious attachments. We discovered that the attack used techniques such as
exploitation of long-closed vulnerabilities and social engineering campaigns.  

The image below showcases Chinese and Pakistani fighter war games with a
CVE-2019-0808 exploit code that drops and executes Patchwork APT payloads
on victim machines. 

Technical Analysis: 

Our analysis is based on a sample that was found in the
wild on January 18, 2021 with SHA- 256
7fb7944fb452d8588194ea746910ed782865efb991fa02479e429f8fba677d3b. The
sample is a malcrafted Microsoft document with an EPS
script that exploits the CVE-2019-0808 vulnerability. 

CVE-2019-0808 is a privilege elevation vulnerability in the Windows Win32k
component due to the NULL pointer dereference, which leads to an arbitrary
code execution as a SYSTEM user. It allows

the attacker to install and run additional payloads on the victim machine with full
user rights. This APT group implants an extracted EPS script dropped
and executed by the malicious document. The following image
shows the content of the EPS file with the icon.  


The malcrafted EPS scripts drops a Patchwork payload file named
“MSBuild.exe” with SHA256-
446e00a53014006804135ef1c31dac6837c0cf635c26426e396b3067764f956d in t
he path of the infected host as highlighted below. This is a VC+ compiled file
with encrypted data, which decrypts and loads the Windows API function
dynamically during runtime. 

File Path- %Users%\%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start
Menu\Programs\Startup folder 

Interestingly, the payload file has a hardcoded command and control (C2) server
IP, URL and User agent as shown in the image below. 

Upon execution, this file creates a Mutex named
“asssszxxzcccjdddddccccdjjjddssdfgredf ” to mark its presence on the victim
machine and avoid multiple executions of itself as shown in the process explorer
image below. 

The malware payload starts collecting information from the victim
system such as computer name, comspec, home directory, logon
server, the number of processors, and much more using Windows API such
as GetComputerNameA, GetTempPath, and GetConsoleWindow.
The image below shows the system information collected during our analysis. 
The following image shows the stack data, which includes collected system
information such as a universally unique identifier (UUID), username
(#un), computer name (#cn), IP address (#lan), number of processor (#nop) and
version (#ver) along with the C2 IP.  

The Patchwork payload logs keystrokes, screenshots, and running processes with
date and time and stores them in a file named TPX498.dat, in a %Temp% folders.
The image below depicts the contents of the keylogger data file. The payload file
also drops an 9PT568.dat file with ID:e29ac6c0-7037-11de-816d-
806e6f6e69638e6d which might be used for network data encryption. 

Then malware uses the custom encryption logic to encode data and
send it to the C2 server over HTTP communication, as depicted in the Wireshark
image below. The multiple process threads of MSBuild.exe are responsible for
sharing encoded stolen data in a POST request to the server. Each request body
of the POST request ends with a unique identification value &crc=e3a6.

adding an Image File Execution
