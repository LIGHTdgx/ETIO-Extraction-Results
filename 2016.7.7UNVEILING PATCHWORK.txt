The attack was detected as part of a spear phishing against a government organization in Europe 
in late May 2016. The target was an employee working on Chinese policy research and the attack 
vector was a PowerPoint presentation file. The content of the presentation was on issues relating 
to Chinese activity in the South China Sea.After the presentation is opened, the vulnerability highlighted by CVE-2014-4114 is exploited. 
This is a well documented vulnerability commonly called Sandworm, which only works on 
unpatched versions of Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003 and 2007.
Once the exploit worked, it deployed the first stage payload: a compiled AutoIt script. This script 
then bypassed UAC using a known method called UACME, the code for which was taken from an 
online forum.With higher privileges, the first stage payload ran PowerSploit to download code to run a reverse 
shell with Meterpreter – the RAT of the well known MetaSploit framework.
The next stage was exfiltration of document files that are also used to validate the value of the 
infection. If the infected system was deemed valuable enough, the threat actor then infected the 
target host with a second stage payload, which was once again a module built from code taken 
from various online forums and resources.Since the threat had already been detected and stopped, our goal was to discover as much as we 
could about the threat actor. Specifically, we were interested in tools, techniques, and 
procedures (TTPs), so that we would be able to detect the threat in case it succeeded in gaining a 
foothold elsewhere in customers’ assets. Learning about the threat actor’s TTPs would also allow 
us to prevent the threat actor from launching another operation targeted at our customer, as 
well as prevent them from launching similar attacks against other customers in the future.
