Three weeks ago, FortiGuard Labs, along with @_ddoxer (Roland de la Paz), using VirusTotal Intelligence queries, spotted a document with
the politically themed file name “Senate_panel.doc”. This malicious RTF file takes advantage of the vulnerability CVE-2015-1641. Upon
successful exploitation, it drops a malware in the %appdata%⧵Microsoft directory. To evade suspicion by the victim, it also drops a decoy
document which shows the symbol of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan on the first page, but on the next pages shows an article
about the Senate of Pakistan.BADNEWS backdoor is not a sophisticated piece of malware. In fact, it doesn’t use any new malware techniques at all. It is neither packed
nor heavily obfuscated. Its tring obfuscation is just simple reversing and minus 1 encryption. But, it uses proven techniques to bypass the
HIPS detection used by security programs by piggybacking onto a signed legitimate file, which allows it to deliver its malicious payload. It
also proves, once again, that there’s rarely any need to use stealthier or more sophisticated attacks, because simple techniques work.
Bad news though for the bad guys, and good news for our customers, as Fortinet covers detection for the BADNEWS backdoor as
W32/Bdnews.A!tr.bdr and the malicious RTF as MSOffice/CVE_2015_1641.A!exploit.
