(ChatGPT,AI chatbot, ushering in a new era of AI revolution, GPT-3.5 model, supervised and reinforcement learning techniques, rich knowledge, ability to contextualize information, output answers highly similar to human language
(Cybersecurity,attack weapon, privacy risk, fake news, public opinion problems, social stability, threat intelligence, mitigation recommendations, phishing emails, decryption of encrypted data, network attacks, espionage, ransomware, malicious spam, illegal activities, AI-generated content detection technology
(poisoning attacks,AI applications generally face
(evasion attacks,AI applications generally face
(inference attacks,AI applications generally face
(model extraction,AI applications generally face
(Prompt Injection,highly 'intelligent' nature of ChatGPT leads to its unique security issues
(security vulnerabilities,code generated by Copilot
(privacy,ChatGPT collects all input information
(privacy risks,introduced while optimizing user experience
(sensitive information,deduced from session context and information in the session
(social impact,cannot be ignored
(public opinion influence,corpus used to train ChatGPT's model is basically favorable to the political opinion of the United States
(Transformer model,selects output of a given input through probability
(ChatGPT,cannot truly understand human morality, nor does it have its own values and moral tendencies
(content creation industry,ChatGPT's 'knowledge' comes entirely from training data, and ChatGPT has no inherent values or moral consciousness
(weaponization of ChatGPT,assist in cyberattacks and cybersecurity defense
(threat intelligence,model updates have a cycle, real-time threat intelligence cannot be guaranteed
(parsing logs,ChatGPT itself cannot determine the correctness of parsing
(generating detection scripts,strict content security policies make ChatGPT actively refuse to generate cybersecurity-related scripts
(cybersecurity incident response,ChatGPT itself does not connect to the internet and the knowledge base updates slowly
